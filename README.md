# shiny_solow
Shiny applications for teaching the Solow-Swan growth model in discrete time.  Each folder contains an app.m and any other files needed to run the accompanying app on shinyapps.io or your own server.  These were written as a way of teaching myself some R and Shiny, and to create a resource for teaching my introductory students the Solow model.  Since it's meant for introductory students, it's (1) in discrete time (2) abstracts from growth in the effective quantity of labor or investment in human capital (3) uses Cobb Douglas as a particular parametric form for the production function.

Since R isn't my first language, there are likely amateurish aspects of some of the code.

the comparative_steadystates app plots calibrations for two countries and calculates steady state values.

solow_dynamics compares two calibrations and heuristically plots the path of the variables along the functions.

solow_scatterplots plots cross-sectional data for various variables. The scatterplots app uses data from Feenstra, Robert C., Robert Inklaar and Marcel P. Timmer (2015), "The Next Generation of the Penn World Table" American Economic Review, 105(10), 3150-3182, available for download at www.ggdc.net/pwt.
